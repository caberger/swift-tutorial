# Subscribe to Location Demo App

## Purpose

The application shows how to use RXJava with Jetpack compose. Logic is implemented in Java, while the UI is
done with Jetpack Compose.

We use a pure [Single-Source-Of-Truth](https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles).

## Building

The Gradle Wrapper is not part of our source code, so it is not checked into this repository.
If you did not do so already, install your own gradle e.g. with:
```bash
brew install gradle
```

Make sure you select Java 17 or higher as Gradle's Java Version.


## Troubleshooting.

Currently there is a problem with location simulation in the android virtual device emulator, see [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/242438611?pli=1).

You can use the following work around:

- In the Simulator log into Play Store
- install a Mock GPS app like [Mock Locations](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.gavrikov.mocklocations) on your simulator
- enable Developer Settings on your simulator
- In Developer Settings select the installed Mock Simulator as "Mock GPS App"
