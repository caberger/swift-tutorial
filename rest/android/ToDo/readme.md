# Jetpack Compose in Java with kotlin as replacement for layout.xml

## Building

We do not check in gradle wrapper files, because this is not our source code.
You must have gradle installed.

``` bash
brew update
brew upgrade
brew install gradle
```
Befor opening the project in Android Studio for the first time, run the following command once:

``` bash
gradle wrapper
```

Then you can built the project either from the command line with ./gradlew or use Andriod Studio.
