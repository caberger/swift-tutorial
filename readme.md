# Tutorials for Swift Programming

## Material
We use the [Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI)](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) course for these tutorials.

To download the material in .pdf format change to the ./scripts folder in your bash shell and run the following:
```bash
./cs193p-download.sh
```

This will download the course materials to the ./target subfolder of the scripts folder.

## Swift on other platforms

See [remote/readme.md](./remote/readme.md)
