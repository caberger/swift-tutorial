# Tutorials for Swift Programming

## Material
We use the [Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI)](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) course for these tutorials.

To download the material in .pdf format run the following on change to the ./scripts folder in your bash shell and run the following:
~~~bash
./cs193p-download.sh
~~~

This will store the course materials in the ./target folder.

## Console examples for Linux and Windows

If you do not have access to a laptop with OSX you can run a lot of the examples with docker. 
Refer to [docker](./docker) subfolder for this.
